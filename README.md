# Java_CRUD_Application

1. Database Manipulation using Java JDBC:
      Developed a Java application in Eclipse to perform essential CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database named "javacrud." Implemented JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a seamless connection between the Java application and the database.

2. Table Management for "book" Entity:
      Designed and managed the "book" table within the "javacrud" database, containing essential attributes such as "name," "edition," and "price." Utilized SQL statements including INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE to facilitate efficient data management.

3. Dynamic Data Input and Retrieval:
      Created an interactive user interface within the Java application to input and display data from the "book" table. Utilized PreparedStatement to ensure secure and parameterized data insertion, enabling users to seamlessly add and retrieve book details.

4. Error Handling and Exception Management:
      Implemented robust error handling mechanisms by utilizing Java Exception handling techniques. Ensured graceful degradation in cases of connectivity issues or incorrect data entry, enhancing the reliability and stability of the application.
